On 9 July 1970, [Ma] was sentenced to death on the grounds that she was an active counter-revolutionary, and the decision was immediately carried out. During the implementation process, at the execution grounds, Ma Yufang cried out repeatedly about her unjust treatment and shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao.” After the sentence had been carried out, Ma’s husband and children continued to protest against this unjust treatment and filed a number of appeals. In 1974, the autonomous regional high-level People’s court sent some personnel to conduct a comprehensive review of this case with the assistance of political and legal organs at the prefecture and county levels. The facts are:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the past, Ma Yufang’s ideology had been relatively backward, but her personality was very outgoing. Straightforward and quick tongued, [Ma] liked to speak her mind. During 1965, she made huge progress during the mass movement to study the works of Chairman Mao, and participated enthusiastically productive labor. In addition, she actively criticized her own former backward ideology and wrong sayings. The commune deemed her a model for backward individuals who had transformed into vanguards, and bestowed upon her the title of “activist in studying the works of Chairman Mao.” Ma Yufang liked to keep plants and fish. During the early period of the Cultural Revolution, this was considered a “Four Olds” practice, so her house was damaged. She was also identified as a “cow demon and snake spirit” and detained by her production team for criticism and struggles. During the struggles, Ma Yufang’s former criticisms concerning her past backwardness were exposed, and she was given the label of “a radical ideological reactionary who had viciously attacked the Party and socialist system.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Regarding the problem of Ma Yufang’s abuse of Chairman Mao, female commune member Gou XX revealed that during the violent struggle of 1967, Ma said to her: “Ever since the center’s Lin Biao and Jiang Qing have become famous, the next thing you know, people have been dying. People are dying in worse ways than chickens, [and] nobody cares. Before, there was a King Zhou and his wife Su Daji who messed up his kingdom, and now Jiang Qing is messing up Chairman Mao’s kingdom.” As for this incident, Ma Yufang adamantly denied it until her death, and no second witness could be found. The masses reported that Gou suspected Ma Yufang and [Gou’s] husband had had illicit relations, and only after picking a fight with Ma did she then bring this issue to light. Therefore [Gou’s words] are unreliable, [and whether the incident occurred] cannot be determined."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Regarding vandalizing the portrait of Chairman Mao, the original verdict ruled that “Ma Yufang used the Chairman’s portrait as menstrual pads.” The re-investigation showed that sent-down youths Liu XX and Wu XX reported that, “on 10 May 1970, Ma Yufang was locked up by the production team. [The girls] wanted to live in Ma’s place, [and] when they ordered Ma to move her things from the room, they saw at the bottom of Ma’s suitcase some menstrual pads, which were lying on top of a small portrait of Chairman Mao.” [They] did not say that the portrait was used as menstrual pads; Ma Yufang also appealed many times about this incident. The original material submitted for inspection was a big portrait, [and] the county hospital’s laboratory concluded that, “the big portrait has a few small dots that look like traces of white vaginal discharge.” The investigator actually wrote “has traces of white vaginal discharge.” During the review, the two portraits, both big and small, were sent to the public security bureau of the autonomous region for verification, and the conclusion is that “there is no clear sign of blood anywhere.” The original ruling that claimed Ma Yufang had vandalized Chairman Mao’s portrait was completely unfounded."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In reality, the materials related to Ma Yunfang’s other crimes were all taken from gossip and rumors gathered from the masses during the early 1970’s struggle meeting against Ma. Three months afterwards, they were compiled as written evidence by one personnel member of the work team (some [incriminating evidence] were not read out to the individual under investigation), and the materials were stamped with fingerprints and sealed to close the case. The political legal organs at the county, district, and regional level never reviewed the case, and therefore the verdict is unreliable."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Based on the review, in June 1976 the autonomous region’s Party committee discussed and decided that the Ma Yufang Counterrevolutionary Case was indeed given an unjust verdict and [Ma] should be thoroughly vindicated. Experiences must be summed up, and lessons learned. And at a mass meeting held on 13 June 1977, Ma Yufang was rehabilitated."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Selected from Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region High-Level People’s Court, Case Studies, 1978."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Menghan Yan"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"fc00a3bd03"},"buildId":"Sk_QHO4GJi-ijWrRRIaU5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
