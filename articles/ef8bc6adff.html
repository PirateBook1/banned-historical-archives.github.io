On 15 October 1969, with the approval of the county party committee, [Fu] was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and given the label “active counterrevolutionary.” He was then handed over to the masses working at the fur factory to supervise the implementation [of this verdict]."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"While serving his sentence, Fu made a number of appeals, [and] requested a comprehensive review of the original verdict. From November to December 1977, Lijiang County People’s Court, together with a special investigation group organized by [Fu’s] factory, carried out a comprehensive review. The results of the review are as follows: Regarding the issue of recording personal grievances in hopes of reversing the verdict on the historical crimes committed by his family, father, and relatives, the re-investigation showed that: on 4 May 1964, Xinhua Street community administrators in Dayan, Lijiang County organized youths to listen to old worker Comrade He Bingzhao in the pear garden recall the bitter past and reflect on the present sweetness. Upon hearing Comrade He Bingzhao’s tragic family history, Fu Yucheng became deeply moved. In order to organize Comrade He Bingzhao’s family history, [Fu] took an exercise book from his sister Yu Yuhui (which had a front page covered with many different phrases and people’s names)[and] jotted down some notes, one of which contained the line “father was killed even though he was innocent.” At the time, investigators added “my” to the front of the sentence “father was killed even though he was innocent,” which turned it into “my father was killed even though he was innocent.” The notes recorded by Fu were basically in line with the facts as described by Comrade He Bingzhao at the time. Originally, [this note] was regarded as a record of personal grievances with the hope of reversing the historical crimes verdict for his [Fu’s] family, father, and relatives in the event of a regime change. This did not accord with the facts, and [the claim that the note was intended to be] should be rejected."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Regarding the issue of using a stapler to staple a portrait of Chairman Mao. The reinvestigation showed that in September 1966, Fu used his break time to make a woodblock print of Chairman Mao. The very first print he produced was stapled to a wall in the sewing workshop. Some ten days later, another print was produced, and it was also stapled onto a wall of Chairman Mao’s Quotations by the second factory door. In October 1968, Fu got [another] woodblock print of Chairman Mao from a comrade employed at the district hospital."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[The new print] was cut into a circle, and a stapler was used again to staple it onto a round piece of cardboard (at the time, the Three-Loyalties Movement was taking place).[The portrait] was placed above the factory clock. At this time, it was discovered that the previous two portraits had disappeared due to long exposure to the wind and sun. Fu usually put up pictures, big slogans, and big-character posters using a stapler. In 1968, after public security personnel had pointed out [his mistake], Fu removed the portrait from the clock and placed it within his dormitory. Another individual later asked [Fu] for the portrait. On 1 November of the same year, the public security department tracked down the portrait in order to use it as evidence of [Fu’s] crime."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There were indeed staple marks on the forehead, hat, neck, shirt collar, and ear of the Chairman’s portrait. Fu had used a stapler to put up Chairman Mao’s portrait in order to satisfy the workers’ desire to see it when they were coming to and leaving the workplace. For the sake of convenience, it was usually with a stapler. This was not a crime."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Regarding the issue of defacing a porcelain bust of Chairman Mao with blue ink. The re-investigation showed that at the time, Fu had a porcelain bust of Chairman Mao in his dormitory. Beside the bust of the Chairman there was a blue-colored vase. One day, the windows of Fu’s dorm were open and a bystander noticed that from his angle, it appeared that the bust of the Chairman in the dormitory had taken on a blue shade. At the time, this situation was not reported, but after Fu’s stapling of the Chairman’s portrait was exposed, the bystander reported the incident based on memory. There was no concrete evidence to be found. This claim should also be rejected."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"On 12 January 1978, Lijiang County People’s Court made the following settlement suggestions regarding the case of Fu Yucheng: [Fu’s actions] constituted serious political mistakes. The original verdict should be rescinded, Fu declared not guilty [of counterrevolutionary activities], and to a certain extent his political reputation should be restored. He is not entitled to any salary compensation for the time when he served his sentence. After being restored to his former job post, his [new] salary should be set at one rank above the current salaries. Lijiang County Party Committee commented that they agreed with suggestions made by the Party group of the county People’s court. They declared Fu not guilty and cleared his name. [He was] not entitled to any compensation for his salary (just a living allowance). After being restored to his former job post, his salary would be set at one rank above the current salaries."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"On 17 September 1978, Lijiang Prefecture’s Middle-Level People’s Court suggested in their review that they agreed with the Lijiang County Party Committee’s suggestions to rescind the original verdict and declare [Fu] not guilty.

Lijiang Prefectural Party Committee commented that they approved of [the court’s decision] to rehabilitate Fu, rescind the original verdict, declare [Fu] innocent, and to have his salary be determined by his former work unit."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"Selected from Lijiang Prefecture’s Middle-Level Peoples’ Court in Yunnan, “Report on the current situation,” Volume 1 (1978)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Menghan Yan"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"ef8bc6adff"},"buildId":"Sk_QHO4GJi-ijWrRRIaU5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
