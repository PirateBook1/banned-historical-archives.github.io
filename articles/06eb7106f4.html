The situation of overseas Chinese, people of Chinese blood with foreign citizenship in some countries and areas, is rather complicated; there are frequently contradictions among them.

In particular, be even more prudent when making assessments of people, naming as few people as possible, or naming none at all."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. Strengthen administration of internal publications; do not arbitrarily expand circulation ranges. Comrades authorized to read internal publications as specified in regulations must unquestionably respect regulations on safeguarding secrets, the distinction between internal and external, that one may not casually talk about or disclose materials from internal publications to one’s friends and children; still less may one give internal materials to outsiders, or even the people concerned, for review, reprinting or copying.
