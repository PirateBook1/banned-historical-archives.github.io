Issue 17 of \"Selections from the White Cloud\" in Guangzhou carried a piece entitled, \"The Spy who Felt that She Had Left Her Body\" and which claimed: during the Second World War, a middle-aged woman said she had left her body in England, yet felt as if her body had gone to The Nazi headquarters in France, reporting of enemy conditions for England. Some days later, the enemy suddenly \"took the exact military measures that she had reported.\" The same periodical carried a series pictorial entitled, \"The Story of a Woman who Came Back to Life After a Thousand Years Buried with the Dead\" in issues 12 and 13, saying that a woman who had been buried very deep underground for a thousand years came across two grave robbers and came back to life.  Last year's 8th issue of the youth publication \"Golden Age\" printed an article called, \"Challenges Facing Modern Science\" describing how a man named Stefan used \"conceptual power\" to make \"spirit journeys\" or to \"free his body from his spirit\", \"making his presence felt\" in a female actor's bedroom at eleven o'clock in the night, etc."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some periodicals and tabloids persist in carrying martial arts, detective, thriller and love stories, exaggerating murder stories and horrible events, publicizing the supremacy of love.  The majority of these publications are appeal to base tastes, having a corruptive affect on youth."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In addition, there a few tabloids who specialize gathering information scraps on the marriage, love and social affairs of film and theater stars and artists.  For example, last year's 9th issue of \"Window on Film and Theater\" from Maoming carried eight articles delving in film set and social gossip on ten film and theater stars. Issues 11 through 16 carried social gossip on more than 30 foreign, Taiwanese, Hong Kong and domestic film and theater stars.  The articles contained a good amount of vulgar, low-class wording.  The top front-page article in issue 16 was the senseless and vulgar, \"The Adventures of 'Hong Kong Sis'\"."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The editor of issue 6 of Guangdong's \"Propaganda Trends\" stated: when periodicals and tabloids carry these types of articles, they are corrupting readers, particularly youth, and treading behind the back of Central appeals to strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.  This type of situation deserves the attention of Party committee propaganda departments at all levels; measures are to be adopted realizing comprehensive rectification."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 16, March 24)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"8df372db67"},"buildId":"Sk_QHO4GJi-ijWrRRIaU5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
