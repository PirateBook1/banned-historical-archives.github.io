Therefore, corresponding provisions concerning the question of removing landlord and rich peasant element labels and the question of the status of the children of landlords and rich peasants which are appropriate to the new situation have been issued. The Center thinks that in the process of discussing and putting into practice the new “60 Articles,”[3] every locality should implement the regulations in this regard. It will be beneficial to mobilize every positive factor better and to turn negative factors into positive factors. For this reason, the Center specifically makes following decisions:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"1. With the exception of a tiny minority who uphold a reactionary standpoint and have not yet been reformed, all landlord and rich peasant elements as well as counterrevolutionary elements and bad elements who for many years have respected the governmental laws and decrees, labored honestly, and done nothing bad, will without exception have their labels removed after mass evaluation and approval through revolutionary committees at the county level. They should be treated as members of the rural people's communes."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. With regard to members of the rural people’s communes with landlord or rich peasant family backgrounds: their status should without exception be determined as commune members. They should receive the same treatment as other members. From now on, when they enter school, apply for work, are recruited for the army, admitted to the youth leagues and the party, as well as the allocation of work, we should take their political performance into account without discrimination."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. The family background of children of members of landlord and rich peasant families should without exception be commune members. They should no longer be classified as having landlord or rich peasant family backgrounds."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4. Every locality should take the question of removing landlord and rich peasant element labels, and the question of determining the status of the children of landlords and rich peasants, as an important task which has to be accomplished earnestly. Starting from within the party and extending outwards, we should organize the broad ranks of cadres and the masses to earnestly study the party policies and do a good job of the ideological education of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements, as well as their children. In the people’s communes and production brigades public announcements should be put up, concerning those landlord, rich peasant, counterrevolutionary and bad elements for whom a decision has been made to remove labels, as well as the newly determined class status of children of landlords and rich peasants. Meanwhile, for the tiny minority of landlord, rich peasant, counterrevolutionary, and bad elements who have not yet been reformed, we need to continuously strengthen supervision and reform, and implement the policy of giving a way out.[4] Whenever they are fully reformed, they should have their labels removed."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by the Maoist Legacy Project team"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[1] The Third Plenum of the Party’s 11th Central Committee took place in Beijing from December 18 to December 22, 1978."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[2] The document “Nongcun renmin gongshe gongzuo tiaoli (shixing cao’an)” 农村人民公社工作条例(试行草案) [Working Regulations of the People's Commune (Provisional Draft)] was passed by the Third Plenum.
