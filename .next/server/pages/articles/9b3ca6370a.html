The 7th Plenum of the Party’s 11th Congress has announced that the 12th Congress will be opened on September 1. The entire nation’s people is surging on the wave of new achievements in production and work in expectation of the 12th Congress. Propaganda in newspapers and periodicals must use this beneficial opportunity, continuing to arouse, using the irrefutable new progress, new accomplishments and new model workers that we have made and won in all areas to mobilize the confidence of people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out the construction of socialist modernization in unswerving unity. Arousing the efforts of the entire nation’s people (this naturally means arousing real efforts--it does not mean faking, big talk or empty words) is the common and basic task of all our newspapers and periodicals. Quite a few newspapers and periodicals across the country are fully aware of this major undertaking they are faced with--the results in this respect since the 3rd Plenum have been remarkable. There are, however, a considerable amount of newspapers and periodicals whose propaganda has been insufficiently persistent in arousing; some are even somewhat half-hearted. This problem must be stressed. Those newspapers and periodicals whose editorial departments comprise certain comrades whose ideological awareness is deficient, causing these circumstances, must adopt a strict attitude and turn the situation around."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. Some theoretical articles that have recently been published in some newspapers and periodicals have to this day not done very well in proceeding from actual circumstances; in making concrete analysis and explaining problems, they continue to go about deducting from average principles and theories or inferring from past experience. Though these kinds of articles are plentiful and eloquent, quoting the classics and other authoritative works, but since they don’t touch on actual issues in the construction of spiritual and material socialist civilization, they have no effect among cadres and the masses. This has been a common shortcoming in theoretical propaganda for a long time now. Central-leaders have spoken of it many times; ardent efforts must definitely be made to solve it. We ask Propaganda Departments under Party Committees and editorial offices at relevant newspapers and periodicals in all parts to exert great effort in grasping this issue, striving to bring about a clear redirection within a short period of time."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 48, August 16)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"9b3ca6370a"},"buildId":"Sk_QHO4GJi-ijWrRRIaU5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
