This has had a negative impact in society. Most recently, a leading comrade with the Center pointed out with respect to the publication of books dealing with the “Cultural Revolution” that in view of the Center’s consistent spirit of uniting as one, looking forward, and dealing with historical matters in a sweeping rather than in a finicky way; and in view of comrade Deng Xiaoping’s instructions about the need at present to strengthen the Party’s concentrated and unified leadership and to make full use of its dominant political position, there is really no need to consider the publication of a Dictionary of the Cultural Revolution, since a work of that kind in all likelihood would be controversial and lead to the reopening of old controversies. To disregard the Notification [in this matter] issued earlier by the Central Propaganda Department, to present the department with a fait accompli, and in this way force the Center to give permission to publish, is unacceptable.1 [We] reaffirm the regulations laid down by the Center in the past and stress the detrimental effect that the publication of books of this kind may have. Consequently, in the foreseeable future we will not even consider applications [for permission] to publish a Dictionary of the Cultural Revolution."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In connection herewith, we issue the following regulations to govern the publication of books about the “Great Cultural Revolution”:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"1. From now on and for quite some time, publishing firms should not plan the publication of dictionaries or other handbooks about the “Great Cultural Revolution.” Unless special permission to publish has been granted by the Central Propaganda Department and State Press and Publications Administration, any such titles already under way (or already printed) should be withdrawn and a report stating the circumstances should be submitted to the Central Propaganda Department and State Press and Publications Administration."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. Under normal circumstances, one should not plan to publish titles specifically researching the “Great Cultural Revolution” or specifically telling the history of the “Great Cultural Revolution.” Separate permission to publish works on selected topics of definite value should be sought by local publishing firms from provincial (autonomous regional, municipal) Propaganda Departments and by central publishing firms from the superior ministry (commission) under which they belong. These [superior bodies] should in turn carry out a rigorous investigation and produce a written report stating their reasons and apply for final permission to publish from the State Press and Publications Administration and the Central Propaganda Department."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. Recently quite a number of recollections, memoirs, reportage literature, etc., dealing with the “Great Cultural Revolution” have been published, and in principle one should not plan to put out any more. The publication of works that have as their theme the so-called “unofficial history” and “secret story” of Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” and works in which there is a lot of chasing of the wind and clutching of shadows―hearsay―willful fabrication and distortion of the facts, should cease. Separate permission to publish seriously and conscientiously written recollections with a definite value may be sought by local publishing firms from provincial (autonomous regional, municipal) Propaganda Departments and by central publishing firms from the superior ministry (commission) under which they belong. Only when final permission has been granted may one arrange for publication. These recollections must be factually accurate, not violate the spirit of the Center’s “Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People’s Republic of China,” not cite at will historical materials not formally declassified by the Center, and not touch upon the moral character of leading Party and government individuals.2"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4. The above-mentioned kinds of books about the “Great Cultural Revolution,” the publication of which is permitted, may at present be produced and published only by the various People’s Publishing Houses and the relevant central social science publishing houses. No other publishing firms should arrange to publish such books, either in cooperation with or on behalf of others."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"5. The distribution of the above-mentioned kinds of books should be handled exclusively by the Xinhua Book Stores and may not be handled by private or collective book traders."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"6. Translations of foreign works concerning the “Cultural Revolution” are also to be dealt with according to the above principles."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"7. Upon receipt of this notification, publishing firms in the process of printing or arranging for the publication of books about the \"Cultural Revolution” without having been given prior permission from the Central Propaganda Department or the State Press and Publications Administration should, without exception, momentarily suspend the printing and distribution of such books. Meanwhile, they should present to the Central Propaganda Department and State Press and Publications Administration a report on the topics [of the books] and the current situation with respect to their publication, and await further instructions."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"8. These regulations are to be enforced from the day they are received. Those who violate these regulations are, depending on the seriousness of the violation, to be punished either by confiscation of profits, by fines, and/or by holding the leadership responsible. Punishments are to be decided upon by the press and publications bureaus of the provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities, or―when necessary―the State Press and Publications Administration."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"9.
