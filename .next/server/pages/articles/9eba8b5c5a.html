Zhuanzheng is when the ruling class relies on violence to exercise its rule. Each state corresponds to the zhuanzheng of a certain class. Slave society and feudal society are the zhuanzheng of slave owners and feudal lords, capitalist society is the zhuanzheng of the bourgeoisie; these are all instances of zhuanzheng by a minority of exploiters over the great majority made up by the exploited masses. Socialist society is the dictatorship of the proletariat; it is the zhuanzheng of the great majority made up by the exploited masses over a minority of exploiters. What we call relying on the masses to exercise zhuanzheng is a specific manifestation of the zhuanzheng of the proletariat. Chairman Mao says: \"Our state is a people's democratic zhuanzheng led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. What is this zhuanzheng for? Its first function is internal, namely, to suppress the reactionary classes and elements and those exploiters who resist the socialist revolution, to suppress those who try to wreck our socialist construction, or in other words, to resolve the contradictions between ourselves and the internal enemy... The second function of this zhuanzheng is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression by external enemies. In such contingencies, it is the task of this zhuanzheng to resolve the contradiction between ourselves and the external enemy.\"[4]"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"From this we can clearly see that the explanation of zhuanzheng by your deputy police chief is mistaken in the extreme.

If a public security cadre cannot even make sense of what zhuanzheng means, then how could he correctly execute the party's policies? We hope that your work unit will be successful in organizing the great task of studying Chairman Mao's works—you must make sure that each and every person studies, and studies frequently, thus greatly increasing the political level."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"The editors"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translation by Puck Engman[1] In classical Chinese, the term zhuanzheng has long been used to denote a person or clan’s political domination over the realm, with one of the early examples appearing in the Hanshu in reference to the coming to power of Wang Mang and his clansmen, an event that marked the end of the Western Han (206 BCE-8 CE). Modern Chinese dictionaries printed in the People’s Republic of China reserve zhuanzheng for the Marxist term meaning the rule by force of one class over another class and suggest the word ducai for autocratic rule. The English word “dictatorship” is far more versatile, covering everything from one-man rule and the state of siege to the Marxist concept. Not only can it refer to many different types of rule but it can denote both a government's form and its content (the latter being the primary concern in the Marxist usage). Keeping this in mind, it is interesting to note that in Earl Browder’s China’s New Democracy (1943)—which was one of the first books to make Mao’s writings available to an American readership—zhuanzheng was translated alternatively as “dictatorship” and simply “ruled” (e.g., pages 20 and 32). This choice was sharply criticized by liberal writer Lin Yutang who insisted, quite rightly, that there was no such ambiguity in the Chinese term zhuanzheng (see Qian Suoqiao. Lin Yutang and China’s Search for Modern Rebirth. Springer, 2017: 295). However, once we consider the various uses of dictatorship/zhuanzheng in different linguistic environments and conceptual universes it becomes clear that Lin was only right on his own terms."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[2] Here, the deputy police chief is playing around with two homonyms: 政/正 (pronounced zheng in Standard Mandarin but zeng in the Southwestern dialects, which do not possess the retroflex consonants of the North) and 专/钻 (both pronounced zuan in the Southwestern dialects)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[3] Analects 13:6.
