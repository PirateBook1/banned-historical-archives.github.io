[They also] manifestly publicized unauthorized audio recording, video recordings, and externally-aimed propaganda. Yet some comrades persisted with prohibited behavior at the conference, covertly making audio recordings, also revising recording drafts and, beginning with a Guangdong unit, making private copies and passing these between hands. In November last year, the Party Committee School in Yulin county, Guangxi province, carried material sent to it by the Jiangmen Municipal Committee Party school, Guangdong province, in the tenth issue of its \"Selections on Education\", also transmitting the material to the local Party Committee school in Tai'an, Shandong Province, and to some other units. In December last year, the local Party school in Tai'an also carried the material in their \"Selections on Education\", in addition to sending it to almost 180 units in 24 provinces and larger municipalities throughout the country. Following this, the material was also carried in the fourth special edition of the year of \"Trends in Social Science\" of Qingdao; issue 5, 1980, of \"Trends in Social Science\" of Hubei province; and issue 7, 1980, of \"Trends in Social Science\" of Heilongjiang province. As the editions of some publications reached 4-5000 copies, a widespread problem of dissemination of secrets was generated. Having had the problem discovered and pointed out by relevant leading departments, the responsible units for publications in Heilongjiang, Hubei, and other provinces have already organized review discussions, aware that the activities are serious errors in violation of organizational discipline and ardently demonstrating that they have gained from experience, immediately taking measures to avoid a return of unfortunate tendencies."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Moreover, during the course of inspecting this instance of divulging of secrets, the unauthorized carrying in internal publications in some parts of other material from the discussions of central leaders was also discovered, involving some extremely confidential material."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"On the basis of the three orders and five statements policy, the CC has for the past few years strictly respected state and Party secrets, as well as the unauthorized publication and printing of internal speeches by central leadership comrades. Issue 21, 1980, of this publication pointed out that internal material and selections must also pay attention to preserving confidentiality, not tolerating the wanton printing of classified, confidential, or even strictly confidential material simply on the pretext that it is being used for \"internal matter\" or \"internal publication\", not having considered whether or not state or Party interests will be harmed. The issue also pointed out that typical internal publications for studies and academic reaserch selections should not carry confidential material of a political nature. Yet some units have paid sufficient attention, with the arbitrary printing of grapevine information or internal speeches by leading comrades still occurring. How is it that clear regulations and a confidentiality preservation system are not respected, not implemented? This demonstrates that there are some comrades whose awareness in in keeping confidentiality or organizational discipline is weak, also demonstrating that the harmful currents and tendencies of Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four's\" sabotage of efforts to uphold confidentiality are far from being eliminated. It is our hope that in the treating of this matter, the concerted attention of Propaganda Departments and relevant Party offices in all parts will be drawn, strengthening training of cadres and Party members in the upholding of confidentiality, perfecting the confidentiality-preservation system and plugging up all loopholes. All departments and units dealing with internal publications must absolutely strengthen leadership of publications. Leading cadres must strictly check and resolutely abandon the thinking and slack of \"seeking out novelty\" and \"beating others to it\", undisciplined styles of work."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 36, July 20)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"fe69b08663"},"buildId":"Sk_QHO4GJi-ijWrRRIaU5","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
